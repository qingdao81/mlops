        "[Great Expectations](https://docs.greatexpectations.io/docs/) is a popular Python library for validating data in Machine Learning pipelines. It contains several built-in Expectation types to configure tests, as well as integrations with common data structures used to store datasets (e.g. Pandas dataframes, CSV files, MySQL databases etc). We will be using this library to define and run some data quality tests for our dataset. The goal and scope of the exercise here is to get you acquainted with the library and practice of testing for data quality.\n",

        "## Step 4 (Part 3): Minimum Functionality behavioral Tests\n",
        "\n",
        "Unit tests and integration tests play an important role in testing software for bugs, inefficiencies and potential vulnerabilities. Can we employ a similar approach to testing ML models? This exercise introduces the concept of “behavioral testing”  for machine learning models.\n",
        "\n",
        "Minimum Functionality Tests are a class of behavioral tests, and equivalents of “unit tests in software engineering” - a collection of simple examples (and labels) to check a behavior. A recommended practice is to write minimum functionality tests for highly visible/high cost potential failure modes, and for failure modes that you uncover during error analysis to guard against such failures in the future.\n",
        "\n",
        "For this exercise, we will use a popular open source library called [Checklist](https://github.com/marcotcr/checklist) to configure and run behavioral tests for our model. The goal and scope of the exercise here is to get you acquainted with the library and practice of testing for minimum functionality.\n",
